Currently, I have no experience as a teaching assistant, though I plan to gain such experience during my Ph.D. pursuit.

**I strongly disagree with the practice in mainland China that allows undergraduate students to serve as teaching assistants,** even though I have encountered several excellent undergraduate teaching assistants.

My concerns are as follows:
- **Emotional maturity:** Undergraduates are not yet mentally mature enough and can be easily influenced by personal emotions, which might affect how they interact with others.
- **Fairness issues:** Competition among undergraduates, sometimes even across different grades, could lead to biases. Granting them the power to influence grades makes it difficult to ensure fairness.
- **Motivations:** Many undergraduates serve as teaching assistants primarily for financial reasons, rather than out of a passion for teaching or a desire to contribute.

For Institutions and Professors
====
Some undergraduates believe that serving as a teaching assistant will enhance their chances of admission to top institutions. However, based on my interactions with professors in the US, this belief is misguided. Admissions committees at top institutions prioritize research experience, strong academic performance, and demonstrated intellectual curiosity over teaching assistant roles. While teaching experience can be valuable, it is not a decisive factor in graduate admissions, especially for undergraduate students.

Institutions and professors should make this clear to their students, guiding them to focus on developing skills and experiences that truly matter for their academic and professional advancement.
