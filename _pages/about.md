Who I Am
======
I am currently a senior student majoring in statistics at the <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a> (USTC). I am fascinated by statistics. I will be a statistics Ph.D student in September 2025.

Apart from statistics, I am passionate about literature, particularly novels. In my free time, I enjoy softly reading novels aloud, word by word. [*Love in the Time of Cholera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_in_the_Time_of_Cholera){:target="_blank"} is probably the novel that has captivated me the most. I am also fascinated by Japanese literature for its intricate and subtle portrayal of human emotions.
