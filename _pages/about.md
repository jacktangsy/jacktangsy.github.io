Who I Am
======
I am Siyuan Tang. I am currently a senior student majoring in statistics at the <a href="https://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/audsf/list.htm" target="_blank">Department of Statistics and Finance</a>, <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a> (USTC). I am fascinated by statistics. I will be a statistics Ph.D. student in September 2025.

Apart from statistics, I am passionate about literature, particularly novels. In my free time, I enjoy softly reading novels aloud, word by word. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_in_the_Time_of_Cholera" target="_blank">*Love in the Time of Cholera*</a> is probably the novel that has captivated me the most. I am also fascinated by Japanese literature for its intricate and subtle portrayal of human emotions.

Pronunciation
======
Siyuan Tang (唐思远) is my Chinese name, which might be tricky for non-native speakers to pronounce. Here is a guide for English speakers:
- First name "Siyuan" (思远):
  - "Si" sounds like "see" in English.
  - "yuan" sounds similar to "you-en" or "yu-en" said quickly together.
  - The name means "to think ahead and see the future".
- Last name "Tang" (唐):
  - Pronounced like "tongue" but with an open 'a' sound, similar to the "a" in "father".

If you really find it too hard to read my first name, feel free to call me "Tang".
