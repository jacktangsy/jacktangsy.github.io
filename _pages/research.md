As an undergraduate, I am still exploring various research areas and developing my taste. I have written a short [document](https://jacktangsy.github.io/files/Understanding_of_Research.pdf) summarizing my exposure to and understanding of some research areas, including

- Statistical network analysis
- Statistical text analysis
- Deep learning from a statistical perspective

I was a visiting undergraduate under the supervision of Professor [Yang Chen](https://yangchenfunstatistics.github.io/yangchen.github.io//), who provided invaluable guidance and taught me a lot about conducting research.
