As an undergraduate, I am actively exploring various research areas and developing my academic taste. I have written a short [document](https://jacktangsy.github.io/files/Understanding_of_Research.pdf) summarizing my exposure to and understanding of several research topics, including:

- Statistical network analysis
- Statistical text analysis
- Deep learning from a statistical perspective

A table of contents has been added to facilitate my readers.

I was a visiting undergraduate under the supervision of Professor [Yang Chen](https://yangchenfunstatistics.github.io/yangchen.github.io//), who provided invaluable guidance and taught me a lot about conducting research.

Suggestions/Lessons for Conducting Research
====
(The following points can also be found in the [document](https://jacktangsy.github.io/files/Understanding_of_Research.pdf) mentioned above.)

- **Real Data.** Distribution shifts, misclassified instances, missing values, and weak signals (low signal-to-noise ratios) are commonly encountered in real-world data, which is totally different from "textbook examples".
- **Attitudes toward Existing Literature.** Everyone makes mistakes. Good researchers should not completely trust the results from a paper without careful thought. It is sometimes necessary to verify the claims through hands-on implementation.
- **Simulation Studies.** When faced with challenges or counterintuitive results in real-data analysis, conducting simulation studies with synthetic data can often provide valuable insights and validate the reasoning.
- **Communication and Cooperation.** Cooperation is essential in modern research. Good researchers should always save their collaborators' time and communicate effectively. For example, preparing a brief document summarizing key points from the previous meeting, recent progress, and current questions can greatly facilitate the discussion.
- **Academic Writing.** In formal writing, it is important to avoid vague statements such as "almost", "many (much)", "most", "roughly", and "approximately". Instead, we can use precise numbers to convey clear and accurate information. Additionally, taking high-quality notes can help clarify the challenges we are facing and the tools at our disposal. Summarizing the ideas in organized blocks can also save time and improve efficiency in academic writing.
