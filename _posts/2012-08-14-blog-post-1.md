We denote a network with $n$ nodes by its adjacency matrix $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, where $A_{ij} = 1$ if there is an edge (link) between nodes $i$ and $j$ and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. We do not allow for self-edges (self-loops), i.e., the diagonal entries of $\boldsymbol{A}$ are all zero.
