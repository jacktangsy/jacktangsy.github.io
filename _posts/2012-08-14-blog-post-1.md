We denote a network with $n$ nodes by its adjacency matrix $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, where $A_{ij} = 1$ if there is an edge (link) between nodes $i$ and $j$ and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. We do not allow for self-edges (self-loops), i.e., the diagonal entries of $\boldsymbol{A}$ are all zero.

Among various models, the stochastic block model (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378873383900217" target="_blank">SBM</a>) has attracted much attention and is arguably the best studied and most commonly used. Below, we briefly review its setting.

Suppose there are $K$ communities. Each node belongs to only one of the communities. Let $\boldsymbol{c} = (c_1, \ldots, c_n) \in \left\{ 1, \ldots, K \right\}^n$ denote the true community labels of the nodes, and assume $c_i$'s are i.i.d. categorical variables with parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\pi} = (\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_K)$, where $\pi_k \geq 0$ for all $1 \leq k \leq K$ and $\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k = 1$. Conditional on the community labels, the edge variables $A_{ij}$'s are independent Bernoulli variables with $\mathbb{E} \left[ A_{ij} \mid \boldsymbol{c} \right] = P(A_{ij} = 1 \mid \boldsymbol{c}) = P_{c_ic_j}$, where $\boldsymbol{P} \in [0, 1]^{K \times K}$ is the symmetric edge-probability matrix with the $kl$-entry $P_{kl}$ characterizing the probability of connection between nodes in communities $k$ and $l$. Let $\boldsymbol{\Omega} = (\boldsymbol{\pi}, \boldsymbol{P})$.
